# Snippets

This is the start to a simple library of react snippets and a collection of fun coding problems. Additionally, I plan to build this frontend without the help of any styling library as to create a new pattern library of sharable/reusable components from the ground up.

## Coding snippet ideas
Make interactive components with the following coding subjects/problems.

- Fibonacci
- Temp Calculator
- Apartment closest to certain landmarks.
- Sum of squares and cubes calc
- Goldbachs conjecture
- Syracuse formula
- Find Primes

## Chile Components
- Navbar
  - Menu
  - MenuItem
- Sidebar
- Grid
